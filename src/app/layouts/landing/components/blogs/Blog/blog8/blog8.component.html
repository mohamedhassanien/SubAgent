            <p class="o186d">Deciding to Study Abroad is a fascinating decision followed by a million dreams, aspirations, a high salary and a hope of a good life. The idea itself is rejoiceful until the strike of reality! First of all, foreign education comes with a lot of investment. It is an investment of time as well as money. Students usually think that the Return on Investment post their education would be really high and would cover all their expenses. Well, that’s completely possible and true to every extent but not every scenario is as rosy as it seems especially when the education sector is booming as a business. Filtering out the right information from the internet is a difficult task and the over-reliance on agencies has tremendously increased the risk of students making the wrong decision. A wrong decision can cause a student plenty of hardship on a foreign land and may cost his/her future. This is where StudentGator comes to the rescue, StudentGator as a team consists of students who already studied or are currently studying in France. We know the exact situation of the country since we are based in France and can guide students seamlessly through each and every process.</p>

                <p class="o186d">
                    Before suggesting any school it is necessary to understand the complete profile of the student. Understanding the profile is important in determining a course which will suit the student’s interest and background.

                    Post screening and identifying the student’s interest, we would identify the best suiting program and school where our students must apply. Students are provided with multiple options to choose from, we advise students to read the course structure carefully before applying to any school/university.

                    The document requirement for application to a French university/school is normally the same but few universities have a slightly different application procedure and require some additional documentation. StudentGator thoroughly assists its students in preparing all the necessary documents. Main document of focus is the motivation letter or the motivation questionnaire which are asked during the application process. These questions must be well drafted and curated showing clear motivation and interest. We’ll thoroughly help you in drafting a great motivation letter.
