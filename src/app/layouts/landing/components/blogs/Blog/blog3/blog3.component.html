        <h3>Learn the language on the spot</h3>
        <p>To hope to become bilingual, you need to practice, and what better way than to be in France to speak and
            listen to the language. In practice there are many advantages to learning a new language, especially the
            language of Molière. French is the official language of nearly 200 million people, it is also the only
            language with English that is spoken on the 5 continents. Professionally, this facilitates integration into
            the hierarchy, since the more responsible you are in a position, the more likely you are to need a language
            other than your mother tongue, since communication with foreign entities is more common. On a personal
            level, in addition to the fact that speaking several languages is always a good idea, it can facilitate your
            travels and meetings with foreigners from other countries. And ideally, you can always move to the
            French-speaking country that has always attracted you. Once you learn the dialect, you will have privileged
            access to more than 47 countries in the world (If you’re not from the 46 countries listed above, then you’ve
            to follow a different procedure known as DAP )</p>
